          <h1>Rama Srinivas</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer who takes an analytical and practical approach to technical problem solving. I am comfortable digging into existing code, debugging issues and exploring new technologies.
            <p>
            I love collaborating with team members and I thrive in different types of environments. 
            In my current projects I am using my creativity and latest technologies to 
            create dynamic web applications that are responsive and user friendly and 
            impactful to a large community of audience. 
            <p>My passion for tackling complex problems inspires my professional work 
            as well as many hours spent contributing to non-profit projects. 
            gardening and cooking are also my favourite things.
            </p>
